# Color Picker Project Documentation

## Overview

The Color Picker project is a web-based application that allows users to interactively select colors from a color wheel with various gradients. It provides a visually appealing interface for choosing colors and outputs the selected color's RGB and hex values.

## Features

1. **Color Wheel:**
   - The color wheel is comprised of eight different gradients that combine to form a complete color spectrum.

2. **Color Selector:**
   - A small circular color selector allows users to pinpoint a specific color on the wheel.

3. **Lightness Control:**
   - The color wheel is surrounded by a lightness control wheel, enabling users to adjust the brightness of the selected color.

4. **Output Information:**
   - The selected color's RGB and hex values are displayed in an input field for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-picker.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the Color Picker application in your web browser.
2. Interact with the color wheel by clicking and dragging the color selector.
3. Adjust the lightness control wheel to modify the brightness of the selected color.
4. Observe the RGB and hex code values in the input field.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main files and directories:

- `index.html`: HTML file for the user interface.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling user interactions and color calculations.

## How It Works

1. The color wheel is generated using multiple gradients to create a visually appealing spectrum of colors.
2. The color selector's position is tracked using JavaScript based on user interactions.
3. The lightness control wheel modifies the brightness of the selected color.
4. RGB and hex code values are updated in real-time and displayed in the input field.
